# Tileset-Test

This is a demo for a project a working on.

# Some simple instructions for how to correctly change things:
To change how the world looks: change the numbers in rooms/tileset.txt to a one or a zero
To change the zoom level: Change the variable zoom_level in the beginning of the main.py file. (Note that only whole numbers work)
