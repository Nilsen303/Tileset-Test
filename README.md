# Tileset-Test

This is a demo for a project a working on.

# Some simple instructions for how to correctly change things:
To change how the world looks: change the numbers in "rooms/tileset.txt" to a one or a zero. (Note that adding numbers instead of replacing them will only mess with the code)

To change the zoom level: Change the variable "zoom_level" in the beginning of the main.py file (Note that only whole numbers work).
